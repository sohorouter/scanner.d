<h1>Default Server Root</h1>
<br>
You are at this Webserver's default  root. As you can see there is nothing here.<br>
<br>
You surely don't want to be here. To get here you probably:<br>
<ul>
	<li>Connected with an unassigned ip address instead of a hostname
	<li>Connected with a hostname not configured to deliver web content
	<li>Used a web browser older then Moses which does not support the HTTP/1.1 protocol 'Host:' header
	<li>Have become completely and hopelessly lost
</ul>

</body>
