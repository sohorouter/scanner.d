<h1>Naturopath Approved!</h1>

<p><a href="http://banners.leadingedgecash.com/banners/product/naturopath_license.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://banners.leadingedgecash.com/banners/product/naturopath_license.gif" width=150 height=107 border=0 hspace=4 vspace=4 align=right></a>Like most gay men, I feel the pressure of expectations to be ever-ready, potent, and "bigger than life." As a naturopath, I wanted to find a product that would make use of the principles of botanical medicine and would be safe, non-toxic, effective and, if necessary, reversible. I searched for a product that would contain the combination of botanicals which I would use if I were compounding the formula myself.</p>

<p>Many of the popular nutraceutical size and potency enhancers on the market contain yohimbe, and some contain caffeine or other stimulants. Enzyte, in particular, contains a considerable amount of yohimbe. Over time, caffeine and other stimulants in additional daily doses can impair sexual performance rather than enhance it. In the medical literature, yohimbe and its derivatives are even referred to as "the ideal anxiety-producing substances." None of that bodes well for increased size, endurance, and drive. I want to thank the knowledgeable people who formulated <a href="http://www.vigrx.com/clicks/clickthrough.html?a=jennycards&b=1316&t=largerpenisgrow">VigRX<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP></a> for choosing a combination that covers all the bases, and includes protection for the prostate, while excluding the ultra-stimulants and anxiety-producing agents that ultimately dampen libido.</p>

<p>My own experience with <a href="http://www.vigrx.com/clicks/clickthrough.html?a=jennycards&b=1316&t=largerpenisgrow">VigRX<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP></a> produced noticeable results after the first day. My erection was firmer and longer-lasting, my libido was enhanced, and the thickness, volume, and duration of my ejaculation was increased. After two weeks of using the product, I noticed a sustained increase in my size when flaccid -- perhaps a half inch or so. In addition, both my penis and scrotum have become thicker and more supple. I also have the kind of sustained interest in sex, even after the first ejaculation, that is not ordinarily possible with legitimate supplementation. As you might imagine, my partner is appreciative, as am I. I continue to use your product, and continue to see improving results. I can heartily endorse <a href="http://www.vigrx.com/clicks/clickthrough.html?a=jennycards&b=1316&t=largerpenisgrow">VigRX<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP></a>.</p>

<p>Thank you,<br>
