<h1 align="center">Sample Home Page for APACHEDFT Server</h1>

<p align="left">This is the sample home page for the APACHEDFT
server, the default server of the <i>IBM HTTP Server for iSeries</i><em>
(powered by Apache)</em>.

<p align="left">If you want to serve additional pages using
APACHEDFT, place them in the /www/apachedft/htdocs directory. To
serve a different home page than this one, replace the index.html
file in that directory.

<p align="left">Additional HTTP servers can be created and
configured by pointing your Web browser to the 2002 port of your
iSeries. You will need to make sure the ADMINA server is started.
