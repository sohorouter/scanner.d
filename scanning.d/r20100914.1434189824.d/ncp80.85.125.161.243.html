<h2>Your Document Body (This is a size 2 header)</h2>
This is an example of a simple Home Page. This is the first paragraph. To see the HTML source that generates this document, use your browser's command to view HTML source. You can save this document in HTML source format and then modify it to create your own document.
<p><hr>
<h3>Links (This is a size 3 header)</h3>
This paragraph shows a text link to another document. This is a link that will take you to the <a href="http://www.ics.raleigh.ibm.com/">IBM HTTP Server Web Site</a> if you have connectivity to the Internet.
<p>
<!-- To make a link within the same document work, you must also insert a "name=anchorname" attribute in the definition of the link you are jumping to.   -->
 This paragraph shows a text link to another point within this document - the footer at the bottom of this page. This link will scroll the page down to the <a HREF="#Footer">Footer</a>.
<p><hr>
<h3>Text (This is a size 3 header)</h3>
Here is an example of a word in <i>italics</i>. Here is an example of a word in <b>bold</b>.
<p>This is an example of an in-line (in a text line) GIF image:<img SRC="/sample/graphic4.gif" alt="Sample Inline Image"> . It is not a link, it is just an illustration that is embedded inside a text paragraph.
<p>Sometimes you need text to align vertically. You can use fixed width fonts. Here is an example:
<p><pre>
   Row one: column1 column2 column3
   Row two: column1 column2 column3
</pre><br>
This is an unordered list with three items:
<p><ul>
<li>item one<br>

<li>item three<br>

</ul>
This is a numbered list:
<p><ol>
