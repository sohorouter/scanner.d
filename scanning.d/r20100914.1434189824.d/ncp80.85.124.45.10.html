<font size="-1">Within the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) there are some 41 contracting states each of which, in accordance with Article 28 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention) and Annex 15 to this Convention, has responsibility for providing an Aeronautical Information Service (AIS). The formal provision of these services is performed by civil and military, state-owned or privatised Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) organisations. Independent of the nature of these organisations, each State remains responsible for the information/data published for and on behalf of itself.    <br>
<br>



AISs are required to ensure the flow of aeronautical information/data necessary for the safety, regularity and efficiency of international air navigation within the area of responsibility of a State. The ANSPs, airspace users, as well as those commercial organisations serving both ANSPs and airspace users depend on the accuracy and timeliness of such data for safe route management, flight planning, and flight operations.     <br>
<br>



The former operational structure had several limitations and drawbacks when seen from a European perspective. Incoherence of cross-border aeronautical information, inconsistent quality of data throughout the ECAC area, lack of interoperability between systems due to different data models and exchange formats, and failures in ensuring timely distribution of aeronautical information updates to all stakeholders may possibly compromise the safety and/or efficiency of air navigation. Last, but not least, the duplicated processes and investments of the current operational structure caused high maintenance (costs) for all those involved.      <br><br>



The cost effectiveness of AIS operations, the quality of aeronautical data and the accessibility and availability of such data can be significantly improved through automation and centralisation. This was the rationale for the development of an European AIS Database (EAD) system and a centralised EAD service: enhance operational safety of air navigation by ensuring the quality of aeronautical information and by facilitating its timely and efficient (electronic) distribution.           <br>
<br>



The EAD offers a substantial improvement on current facilities and processes for the acquisition, validation, and timely distribution of aeronautical information within the ECAC area. On the one hand, it will support and facilitate ANSPs in the maintenance and publication of validated (through consistency and coherence checks) aeronautical information. On the other hand, the EAD will provide a centralised facility supporting the exchange of such information amongst ANSPs as well as the timely distribution of and access to the information by the airspace users community and by other interested parties.     <br>
<br>



The primary beneficiary of the EAD are the ANSP organisations and the airspace users community from the ECAC member states. The EAD is also used by airlines that are based outside the ECAC area and by commercial organisations that use the aeronautical information to provide value added services and products.<br>
<br>



The Implementation of the EAD introduced automation and centralisation in the provision, processing, and distribution of aeronautical information. The identification and removal of redundant processes and of dispersed investments by the involved stakeholders has already resulted in significant technical and financial benefits to all of them.</font>
