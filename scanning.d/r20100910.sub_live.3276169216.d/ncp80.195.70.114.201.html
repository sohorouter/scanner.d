The user fully agrees to these terms of use from the point of time when he / she enters the Internet via the hotspot.

Hotspot offer details

The ICT&S Center at the University of Salzburg provides at present the possibility of an unlimited „Hotspot“-Internet-access free of charge at the Max-Reinhardt-Platz. An identification of the user is not required.
The radio range (hotspot-coverage-area) indicated on the location is a maximum value under optimal conditions. These values are subject to natural fluctuations and are not obligatory. Determined by the system the transmission rate depends on the number of users.
The requirements for using this offer (the Hotspot-Internet-Access) are either a Wireless LAN compatible computer, laptop or PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) and the permission to stay in the designated area.
An e-mail-server is not provided.

Availability, Interferences and Interruptions

The ICT&S Center at the University of Salzburg runs the offered services under consideration of the highest accuracy, liability and availability. For technical reasons it is not always possible to provide continuous access without interruption, to establish the desired connections, or to assure that saved data will be preserved under all given conditions. The ICT&S Center and the University of Salzburg can assume no liability for it. For technical reasons it can not be guaranteed that e-mails arrive or error messages concerning this matter occur. In particular installed (by the user or the ICT&S Center at the University of Salzburg) spam-filters, virus-filters, etc. can prevent the delivery of e-mails. For this purpose the ICT&S Center and the University of Salzburg assume no liability.
The ICT&S Center at the University of Salzburg monitors the functional efficiency of the hotspot and its Internet connection and is anxious to adjust occurring errors, interruptions and interferences if they are known or reported (e-mail: info@icts.sbg.ac.at). In case of an overuse of data transfer the hotspot can be overloaded and might not work. Any claims against the ICT&S Center and the University of Salzburg due to these reasons are impossible.

Obligations and Liability of the User

Improper use and illegal actions in the Internet must not be carried out. In particular the user is obligated to use the services offered by the ICT&S Center at the University of Salzburg in no means, that could damage a third person, or could endanger the safety or the operation of the ICT&S Center at the University of Salzburg or other computers. Thus, spamming (aggressive direct-mailing via e-mail) and any use of the service for transmission of threats, obscenities, annoyances or damages to other Internet-users are prohibited.
Commercial or industrial application of the hotspot by the user is prohibited.
Any dissemination or propagation, especially resale, of the offered services is prohibited.
It is not allowed to send advertisement of domain names or links via mass e-mails (SPAM etc.) or to send any mass e-mails via the hotspot.
Any information transmission (after § 75 Telecommunication Law) that endangers public safety, law and order or morals, or that violates the law, and any harassment or terrifying action to a person or an organization are prohibited.
The user is obligated to be aware of the legal requirements of the prohibitory law concerning political radicalism, the pornography law, the e-commerce law, the telecommunication law, the media law and the respective requirements of the penal code, that concern the restrictions of content distribution. The user is not allowed to deposit illegal or erotic content and information, or to publish illegal content (or links to illegal content) or to refer to such content that is offered to him / her by third person, in any way via hotspot. If the user violates statutory provisions while using the hotspot he / she indemnifies and holds the ICT&S Center and the University of Salzburg harmless from these actions.
If this service is used improperly the ICT&S Center at the University of Salzburg can demand a proof of identity of the user.
Furthermore the ICT&S Center at the University of Salzburg preserves the right to take any further legal measures against improper use, especially complaints of an offence. In particular the ICT&S Center at the University of Salzburg is authorised to completely or partially block the services in case of suspected violations. Furthermore the ICT&S Center at the University of Salzburg can remove information on hosted websites or deny access to them in case of infringements.
In case of offences against the terms of use the user commits himself / herself to indemnify and to hold the ICT&S Center and the University of Salzburg harmless. This applies to any other kind of improper use.
Furthermore the user takes note that the use of the Internet can involve insecurity, e.g. by the recall of data from the Internet viruses, so called Trojan horses, or other components can be transferred to an end device. These components can have negative effects on data and can lead to misuse of access identification. The ICT&S Center and the University of Salzburg assume no liability. Damages, expenses or charges resulting from these insecurities are for the user’s account.

Liability of the ICT&S Center and the University of Salzburg (Downloads, data transfer, data loss, viruses)

The liability of the ICT&S Center and the University of Salzburg for slight negligence (apart from personal injury) as well as consequential damage or loss of profit is generally excluded.
The ICT&S Center and the University of Salzburg are not liable for content, accuracy or completeness of data, messages or information, that are received, transmitted, distributed or accessed by the use of the services provided by the ICT&S Center at the University of Salzburg.
The use of data transmitted via the hotspot is at one’s own risk. Any data is transferred unencrypted via radio – in case of confidential information the user should make safety arrangements for data encryption for his / her own security.
The ICT&S Center at the University of Salzburg is neither authorized nor obligated to monitor content that is produced or transported by users via hotspot. Therefore the ICT&S Center and the University of Salzburg assume no liability for this content.
Data download via hotspot and the use of downloaded programs / scripts is at one’s own risk. The ICT&S Center and the University of Salzburg assume no liability for damages / errors in computer systems or for other damages. In particular the ICT&S Center and the University of Salzburg assume no liability for data prompted by the user in the Internet and for e-mails transmitted or received by the user and for services of third party providers, even if the user found the provided link by the homepage of the ICT&S Center at the University of Salzburg.
The ICT&S Center and the University of Salzburg assume no liability for direct or indirect damages as a result of data transfer, a transmission error, data loss, data insecurity or other reasons as well as for damages as a result of technical problems.

General Details

This offer can be expanded, modified or improved, especially if it is necessary in order to prevent from misuse (e.g. installation of filters) or if the provider is obliged to do so due to changes in the legal situation or by adjudication.
This at present voluntary offer free of charge can be shut down by the ICT&S Center at the University of Salzburg at any time and without advance notice. In this case no demands can be raised to the ICT&S Center and the University of Salzburg.
The ICT&S Center provides the Internet access free of charge at present. However this circumstance does not provide the right for the user to call upon these services free of charge in the future.
The user takes note of the fact that saving passwords, access data and other secret information on the hard disc of a computer, a laptop or PDA is not safe.</textarea></td>
